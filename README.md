## Multivariate Regression Deployment with Flask
This repository contains a web server developed with Flask for deploying a multivariate regression model based on machine learning. The server provides predictions through a simple web interface.

### Repository Structure
pycache: Folder that stores temporary files generated by Python.

GET_prediction: Folder containing the files necessary to make GET requests to the server and obtain predictions.

models: Folder that stores trained machine learning models.

### Main Files
server.py: Main file containing the code to initialize and run the Flask server.

main.py: File containing the code to manage routes and model predictions.

utils.py: Utility file with additional functions necessary for the server's operation.

models.py: File containing the definition and training of the multivariate regression model.

Model Training:
1. Ensure you have the necessary data and train the model by executing:
```bash    python models.py```
2. Server Execution:
Start the Flask server by executing:
```bash    python server.py```
